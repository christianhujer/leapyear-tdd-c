This is a demonstration of how to do test-driven development (TDD) in C, without the use of any framework.
The C standard library has everything you need.
Frameworks are great, but they're optional.
You will want a framework as your number of tests grows,.
But you don't need a framework to get started.

The history of this repository reflects the relevant steps.
